## 2024-05-23 - Next.js Static Export Security Headers
**Vulnerability:** Missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.) in a Next.js Static Export.
**Learning:** `next.config.js` headers configuration is ignored when using `output: "export"`. Security headers must be configured on the web server (e.g., via `.htaccess` for Apache, `vercel.json` for Vercel, or Nginx config).
**Prevention:** Always verify how the application is served (Static vs. Server) and apply security headers at the appropriate infrastructure layer. In this case, `.htaccess` was used.

## 2026-02-07 - Input Length Limits (Defense in Depth)
**Vulnerability:** Missing `maxLength` attributes on user input fields (Login, Articles, Tags). While server-side validation exists via Zod, lack of client-side limits allows sending excessively large payloads, potentially causing DoS or buffer issues, and misalignment with backend constraints.
**Learning:** Even with Zod schemas defining limits (e.g., `max(255)`), HTML inputs default to unlimited length unless explicitly constrained.
**Prevention:** Always mirror backend/schema length constraints to the frontend HTML `maxLength` attribute to provide immediate feedback and reduce server load.

## 2026-02-08 - Target Attribute Case Sensitivity (Defense in Depth)
**Vulnerability:** The HTML sanitizer hook for `rel="noopener noreferrer"` enforcement was case-sensitive, only checking for `target="_blank"`. This allowed links with `target="_BLANK"` (or other case variations) to bypass the protection, potentially exposing users to reverse tabnabbing attacks.
**Learning:** HTML attribute values are case-sensitive for frame names, but reserved keywords like `_blank` are case-insensitive in browser behavior. Security checks must account for this.
**Prevention:** Always normalize attribute values (e.g., `.toLowerCase()`) before checking against reserved keywords like `_blank`, `_self`, etc.

## 2026-02-08 - Missing Schema Length Validation for Email
**Vulnerability:** Missing `.max(255)` constraint on the email field in the `LoginSchema`. This could allow excessively large email strings to be processed, potentially leading to DoS or memory issues.
**Learning:** Zod `email()` validation does not implicitly limit the length of the string to standard email limits (254/255 characters).
**Prevention:** Always include a `.max()` constraint on all string fields in Zod schemas, especially those that accept user input, to enforce defense-in-depth and prevent DoS.

## 2026-02-09 - PII Exposure in Console Logs
**Vulnerability:** The `useContactForm` hook was logging the full error object to the console upon submission failure (`console.error(error)`). In Axios-based requests, this error object often contains the request configuration and data payload (including PII like name, email, phone), exposing sensitive user information in the browser console.
**Learning:** Standard error logging practices (`console.error(err)`) can inadvertently leak sensitive data when error objects contain request context.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize error logs. Log generic messages or specific error codes instead of raw error objects, especially in client-side code handling user input.

## 2026-02-12 - Zod URL Validation Gaps
**Vulnerability:** Zod's `.url()` validation allows schemes like `javascript:`, `data:`, and `vbscript:`, which can lead to XSS if the URL is used in a context that executes scripts (e.g., `href`, `src` with specific exploits).
**Learning:** `z.string().url()` only validates compliance with the URL standard, not safety. It does not enforce specific protocols like `http` or `https`.
**Prevention:** Always use `.refine()` or regex to strictly enforce allowed protocols (e.g., `^https?://`) when validating URLs that will be rendered or stored.
